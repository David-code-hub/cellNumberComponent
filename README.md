### Initial designs
I stuck with the colour scheme from the main landing page(https://rather.chat/). I didn't spend a lot of time on the designs due to time contraints.

For the country code selection, I opted for for an input field instead of the `<select>` element since it's a long list. It also creates a better UX becuase the user can easily search for their respective country.
